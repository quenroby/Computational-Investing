•	Intrinsic Value -
  1. The actual value of a company or an asset based on an underlying perception of its true value including all aspects of the business, 
  in terms of both tangible and intangible factors. This value may or may not be the same as the current market value. Value investors 
  use a variety of analytical techniques in order to estimate the intrinsic value of securities in hopes of finding investments where the 
  true value of the investment exceeds its current market value.
  
  2. For call options, this is the difference between the underlying stock's price and the strike price. For put options, it is the 
  difference between the strike price and the underlying stock's price. In the case of both puts and calls, if the respective difference 
  value is negative, the intrinsic value is given as zero.
  
•	Capital Assests Pricing Model -
  A model that describes the relationship between risk and expected return and that is used in the pricing of risky securities.
  Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM)The general idea behind CAPM is that investors need to be compensated in two ways: time value of money
  and risk. The time value of money is represented by the risk-free (rf) rate in the formula and compensates the investors for placing 
  money in any investment over a period of time. The other half of the formula represents risk and calculates the amount of compensation
  the investor needs for taking on additional risk. This is calculated by taking a risk measure (beta) that compares the returns of the 
  asset to the market over a period of time and to the market premium.
