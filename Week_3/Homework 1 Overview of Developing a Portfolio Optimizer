Important note: This is not a realistic way to build a strong portfolio going forward. The intent is for you to learn how to assess a portfolio.
Homework 1: Scenario
  •	Given 4 equities (symbols)
  •	What would have been the optimal allocation to them for the year of 2011?
  •	Assume: Buy and hold at beginning of year

Part 1 (Look at):
  •	Examples/Basic/tutorial1.py
  •	Examples/Basic/tutorial3.py
  o	Note: The manner in tutorial 3 which we combine the returns from the individual equities to find the performance of the overall portfolio is not the way you should do it in this assignment. 

Part 2:
  •	Write a Python function called simulate()
  •	Inputs:
  o	Start Date
  o	End Date
  o	Symbols
  o	Allocations
  •	Outputs:
  o	Standard deviation of returns of portfolio
  o	Average daily returns of portfolio
  o	Sharpe ratio of portfolio
  o	Cumulative return of portfolio
  Example:
  Vol, daily_ret, sharpe, cum_ret = simulate(startdate, enddate, [‘GOOG’,’APPL’,’GLD’,’XOM’], [0.2,0.3,0.4,0.1])

Part 2.5:
Before going to the next part, make sure your function works correctly by checking on the Wiki for this assignment and look at the sample output. 
  •	Make sure your function provides the correct output
  •	Check against answer on wiki!


Part 3:
  •	Use your simulate() function to build a portfolio optimizer
  •	Do this by testing many portfolios
  •	10% increments (reduces the number of possible portfolios you might have to test so try 1%)
  •	[0.1, 0.1, 0.6, 0.2] (Example of a legal allocation with 10% increments adding all up to 1)
  Essentially test thousands of possible portfolios and find for that list of equalities the optimal allocation. 
  How to do that:
  •	Setup a couple nested for loops where you increment each allocation and check to make sure it’s a legal allocation. In other words they all add up to one. 
  •	Then test it with your simulation 
  •	Record which one is the best
  So the nested for loops, you can just have them generate all the possibilities but only check the ones that add up to one.

Part 4:
  •	Create a chart to show off your fantastic portfolio
  o	Create a chart to show the plotted various parts of your portfolio, and the overall portfolio results, so you rejoice in the success of your portfolio. 



Check the Wiki before taking the quiz to make sure all outputs match.
Example Output:
Start Date: January 1, 2011
End Date: December 31, 2011
Symbols: [‘AAPL’, ‘GOOG’, ‘XOM’, ‘GLD’]
Optimal Allocations: [0.4, 0.0, 0.2, 0.4]
Sharpe Ratio: 1.02828403099
Volatility (stdev of daily returns): 0.0101467067654
Average Daily Return: 0.000657261102001
Cumulative Return: 1.1648721965
